        <h4>What are the benefits of version control?</h4>

        1. It allows collaboration between individuals of a team since different versions of the same file will eventually be merged.
        2. It keeps track of the differences between files saved over time, so that one can revert to previous versions if necessary.
        3. It allow a master to stay intact without fear of losing it.

        <h4>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h4>

        1. Git allows the user to provide detail comments on their commits while working in branches other than the master. Agreement to this workflow between individuals of a team creates an assurance that people are working towards a common goal.

        <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>

        Things can happen (destroy) to personal and work computer harddrives. Having a remote repository provides the redundancy in the work that's done.

            <h4>Let's compare arrays and hashes in Ruby</h4>
            </p>
            	<h5><p>
            	Arrays and hashes are similar in that they are both used in programming to store and retrieve data. What do data come in the form of you ask? Well, data can be objects. An array is a collection of objects. Within an array, you can store anything from string, number, Booleans, and even other arrays. These objects are organized by a counting index. Take this example:</p>
				<pre><code>
					array = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’]
				</code></pre>
				<p>
				The string a, b, c, and d are indexed at the 0, 1, 2, 3 position respectively. Thus, you now know that the index of an array starts with 0, NOT 1.
				</p>
				<p>
				A hash, on the other hand, behaves differently than an array. Instead of using an integer index as its way of organizing, it uses key value pairs. Think of hashes as a dictionary. Any value stored into a hash will be assigned a corresponding key. One thing to remember is that all the keys that you create in a hash needs to be unique. Consider the following example that outputs "no" if you type in the command: puts hash["cat"].
				</p>
				<pre><code>
					hash = {
						"tango" => “whale”,
						"soda" => 1,
						"cats" => “no”
							}</code></pre>

				<p>
				Both arrays and hashes are powerful data structures that can be manipulated by Ruby methods. For example, you can loop through both and perform certain logis within your function. Both arrays and hashes can be made bigger by adding objects into them and made smaller by taking objects out of them.
				</p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Working as a pair for wireframing is good. An advantage is that two people can decide quickly on what to implement drawing upon their experience.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Wireframing helped put the conceptual steps into something to look at quickly. I think once we both had a visualization of the things we were verbalizing, it became easier to continue with the next concept.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

I think we both discussed whether or not if there was a need for a specific blog template if our blog content was going to be dynamic. We decided, for the sake of the exercise, to go with a typical setup that will translate directly to semantic tags.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned about <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <aside>. However, I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to adjust some of the layout without CSS. From what I've seen online, it doesn't seem like it unless I implement Bootstrap; however, that's going back to use CSS.
